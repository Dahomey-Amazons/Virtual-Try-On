# Virtual Try-On (VTO) Feature for Myntra

## Enhanced Shopping Experience
The Virtual Try-On (VTO) feature offers a personalized and engaging way for customers to explore products, significantly boosting user satisfaction and confidence in their purchases.

## Benefits

### Convenience
Shoppers can try on items from the comfort of their homes, reducing the need for physical store visits.

### Reduced Returns
By visualizing products accurately, customers make more informed choices, leading to fewer returns.

### Innovation and Differentiation
Brands incorporating VTO stand out in the competitive market, appealing especially to tech-savvy Gen Z and Millennial consumers.

## How It Works

### Step 1
Ask users to use their phone camera to scan their face or full body from a distance in good lighting conditions on the Myntra app.

### Step 2
Users choose accessories/clothes from their wishlist on Myntra. AR technology adds the chosen accessories (like sunglasses or hats) to their live camera view.

### Step 3
Users can adjust how accessories look and decide which ones they like. They can add their favorites to the cart directly.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion
```

2. Create a conda environment and install the required packages

conda activate ootd
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference
1. Half-body model

```sh
cd OOTDiffusion/run
python run_ootd.py --model_path <model-image-path> --cloth_path <cloth-image-path> --scale 2.0 --sample 4
```

2. Full-body model 

> Garment category must be paired: 0 = upperbody; 1 = lowerbody; 2 = dress

```sh
cd OOTDiffusion/run
python run_ootd.py --model_path <model-image-path> --cloth_path <cloth-image-path> --model_type dc --category 2 --scale 2.0 --sample 4
